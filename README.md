## About

### The idea

For my **first milestone project** i wanted to make a website that i can use for my **headshots business**. The reason for this is that i have many nice pictures that i can use for free. The images are from my portfolio and the people in there have all given their written permission that i can use the images for portfolio and social media. Within the headshot business, it´s common to use a one-page site. I wanted the site to look clean and professional, trustworthy. I think that the font **Lato**, is giving a professional, not to shouty, friendly and professional impression.

### The business

The business is a small one, just me. The people that would be interested in my services are actors, professionals with a LinkedIn profile, writers, journalists and maybe even people active on dating sites. For example, an actor need to showcase him/her when applying for jobs, so they need good headshots. 

#### Company Goals and needs

For the company, it´s about showcasing the images and attract new clients. I want to show them i take good images, that other people like what i do and that i am worthy of their trust.

#### Client goals and needs

There are loads of photographers out there. When potential clients come to my site, they need to be able to form an opinion on how good images i take and how my prices compare to the competition. It´s also important that they can see where i am located. Those things in particular need to be very visible to them.

## Features

Potential clients can look at my work and book a session. They can also contact me via email, phone or reach out on social media. 

## Manual testing procedures

I have been using the Google Chrome dev tools to make sure the site looks good on different devices/screens. I designed the page to be optimized at the dev tools breakpoints and i also looked at what intervals it didn´t look so good in and then added a media querie there. 

I have tested the functionality myself and i also asked my girlfriend to try it out. 

I also used Lighthouse in dev tools. It gave me the information that my performance is at 74, and that i could take a look at the sizing of images. When we try it out on different devices it´s quick enough, so for now i let it be. The image sizing and best practice with images is something i will have a look at more in depth for future projects.

### Header menu

The links in the menu is supposed to take the user to different sections on the site. They work as expected when tested. 

### Portfolio carousel

It´s supposed to go around by itself like a carousel, and it does. We have also tried out the controls to see if they take the user manually from image to image as they should. They do that.

### Pricing card buttons

These buttons will take the user to external booking pages, one for each package. They worked as they should when we tested.

### The contact form

I put required on all the fields and the consent checkbox. Everything works as it should and if something is missing there will come a little pop up message. I used the same url that you guys used to dump the info in the form. 

### Footer links

There is a navigation menu, a contact menu and links to social media. When tested, they worked fine.

## Acknowledgements

The portfolio carousel is just copy pasted from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/). They make really nice things!

The fine folks at Google has provided the map i use to show the studio location.

I would also like to thank the tutors for their patience with me. They are always helpful and all of them seem to have a great sense of humour!
