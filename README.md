# Website for headshot photography business "Christians Photo"

## Description

For my **first milestone project** i wanted to make a website that i can use for my **headshots business**. 

The business is a small one, just me.

The images are from my portfolio and the people in there have all given their written permission that i can use the images for portfolio and social media.  

The people that would be interested in my services are actors, professionals with a LinkedIn profile, writers, journalists and maybe even people active on dating sites. For example, an actor need to showcase him/her when applying for jobs, so they need good headshots. 

The first thing they look for when coming to the site is the **price** and the **images**. 

I also wanted the site to look clean and professional, trustworthy. I think that the font **Lato**, is giving a professional, not to shouty, friendly and professional impression.

Within the headshot business, it´s common to use a one-page site.

## Manual testing procedures

I have been using the Google Chrome dev tools to make sure the site looks good on different devices. I used the breakpoints in the dev tools and designed the page to be optimized at those and i also looked at what intervals it didn´t look so good in and then added a media querie there.

## Acknowledgements

The portfolio carousel is just copy pasted from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/). They make really nice things!

The fine folks at Google has provided the map i use to show the studio location.

My mentor [Excellence Ilesanmi](https://github.com/lon-io), has done a great job in helping me in a good way. The mentoring sessions has been really helpful!

I would also like to thank the tutors for their patience with me. They are always helpful and all of them seem to have a great sense of humour!

The people hanging out on Slack has also been very helpful.
