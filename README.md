# Web-site for photography headshot business "Christians Photo"

## Description

For my **first milestone project** i wanted to make a website that i can use for my **headshots business**. 

The business is a small one, just me.

The images are from my portfolio and the people in there have all given their written permission that i can use the images for portfolio and social media.  

The people that would be interested in my services are actors, professionals with a LinkedIn profile, writers, journalists and maybe even people active on dating sites. For example, an actor need to showcase him/her when applying for jobs, so they need good headshots. 

The first thing they look for when coming to the site is the **price** and the **images**. 

I also wanted the site to look clean and professional, trustworthy. I think that the font **Lato**, is giving a professional, not to shouty, friendly and professional impression.

Within the headshot business, itÂ´s common to use a one-page site.
