## About

### The idea

For my **first milestone project** i wanted to make a website that i can use for my **headshots business**. The reason for this is that i have many nice pictures that i can use for free. The images are from my portfolio and the people in there have all given their written permission that i can use the images for portfolio and social media. Within the headshot business, it´s common to use a one-page site. I wanted the site to look clean and professional, trustworthy. I think that the font **Lato**, is giving a professional, not to shouty, friendly and professional impression.

### The business

The business is a small one, just me. The people that would be interested in my services are actors, professionals with a LinkedIn profile, writers, journalists and maybe even people active on dating sites. For example, an actor need to showcase him/her when applying for jobs, so they need good headshots.

## Features

Potential clients can look at my work and book a session. They can also contact me via email, phone or reach out on social media. For the company, it´s about showcasing the images and attract new clients.

## Manual testing procedures

I have been using the Google Chrome dev tools to make sure the site looks good on different screen-sizes. I designed the page to be optimized at the dev tools breakpoints and i also looked at what intervals it didn´t look so good in and then added a media querie there. I have tested the functionality myself and i also asked my girlfriend to try it out.

### Header menu

The links in the menu is supposed to take the user to different sections on the site. They work as expected when tested. 

### Portfolio carousel

It´s supposed to go around by itself like a carousel, and it does. We have also tried out the controls to see if they take the user manually from image to image as they should. They do that.

### Pricing card buttons

These buttons will take the user to external booking pages, one for each package. They worked as they should when we tested.

### The contact form

I put required on all the fields and the consent checkbox. Everything works as it should and if something is missing there will come a little pop up message. I used the same url that you guys used to dump the info in the form. 

### Footer links

There is a navigation menu, a contact menu and links to social media. When tested, they worked fine.

The fine folks at Google has provided the map i use to show the studio location.
